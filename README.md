Backup of a couple of Huginn scenarios. As of the creation, both are monitoring RSS feeds and sending a message about new posts to a Discord webhook.

Also, a javascript snippet to export all Huginn scenarios into a json array format. Unfortunately, I don't know enough about Ruby to figure out how to get Huginn to import a json array.

Also included is a document for creating the webhook in Discord, because, why not?
